# Bluepy the AI-Driven Blueprint Node gen tool for Unreal Engine

## Overview
This project introduces a revolutionary plugin for Unreal Engine that enables the generation of Blueprint nodes based on unique data inputs using OpenAI's API. It's designed to streamline the development process, allowing for the dynamic creation of game logic without the need for repetitive manual coding of common functionalities.

## Features
- **Dynamic Node Generation**: Automatically generates Blueprint nodes and their connections based on the unique data provided by the user.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's API to interpret user requests and generate corresponding Blueprint logic.
- **Customizable Templates**: Offers a base template for nodes that can be easily customized to fit any project's needs.
- **Interactive Blueprint Graph**: Enables users to chat directly within the Unreal Engine Blueprint graph and integrate generated code seamlessly.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 4.26 or newer.
- An active OpenAI API key.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the plugin into your Unreal Engine project's plugins folder.
3. Restart Unreal Engine and enable the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu.

### Usage
1. Open the Blueprint editor in your project.
2. Activate the plugin through the editor's toolbar.
3. Enter your request for Blueprint logic in the plugin's chat interface.
4. The plugin will communicate with OpenAI's API, retrieve the necessary unique data, and generate the corresponding Blueprint nodes.
